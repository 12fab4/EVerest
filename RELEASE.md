# Release Process
EVerest will create releases on a monthly base. This frequency is related to the monthly Technical Steering Committee meetings.

For the everest-core repository, the releases are tagged using the following name pattern: _YEAR.MONTH.INDEX_, e.g. 2022.12.1

For libraries, semantic versioning is used.

Find details about the releases on the corresponding release pages of the repos. E.g. for everest-core: [Release page of everest-core repository](https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/releases)

First of all, there will be source code releases for EVerest. Binary releases for different hardware platforms will follow soon.
